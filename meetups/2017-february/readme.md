### A Go developer's notebook - presented by [_Eleanor McHugh_](https://twitter.com/feyeleanor)

Ellie's talk contained a heady mix of Go code and publishing history. The talk aimed to inspire us both to learn a new programming language and to consider taking whatever our interests are and turning them into a book using the Leanpub self-publishing platform to help others learn from our experience.
