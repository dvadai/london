# Ladies of Code LDN | [December 2016 - 24 Pull Requests event](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/235269913/)

We are passionate about open source and this event format allows us to spend some time together to make open source contributions.

We ran this full day event for the second time in collaboration with [Codebar](http://codebar.io) and [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/).

During the event beginners were paired up with more experienced programmers to raise pull requests to selected beginner-friendly open source projects. This helped to lower the barrier for beginners to contribute to open source projects and several people raised their first PRs ever on that day!

We had several speakers during the day including:

- [Andrew Nesbitt](https://twitter.com/teabass), the initiator of 24 Pull Requests, who shared how the project started and how quickly it has grown over the last year.
- [Charlotte Spencer](https://twitter.com/Charlotteis), who talked about how to get started in Open Source.
- [Kimberley Cook](https://twitter.com/KimberleyCook91), a Codebar co-organiser, who presented some tips and tricks of how to find a beginner friendly open source project on Github.


Codebar is a weekly meetup which helps coding newbies of under represented groups in tech to get up to speed with programming.

24 Pull Requests is an initiative that supports open source contributions. The goal is that participants will raise 24 pull requests to open source projects during the month of December.
