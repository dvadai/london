# Ladies Who Code LDN | [April 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/events/220599100/)

For those who made it to our February 'Everyone's new at something' meetup, [Maya Bonkowski](https://twitter.com/MayaInnoNinja) who spoke about Coding on the metal (on the processor) was our speaker again in April; back by popular demand!
This month she discussed **_Low-level graphics with math and *those* dirty memory pointers ;)_**

A very brief intro into:
+ Abstract algebra that nobody told you already know
+ How number systems we use are intuited to a context rather than mathematics being an absolute
+ Why memory pointers have a bad reputation

And how to use all of the above good stuff to mess around in video frame buffers to do realtime effects.

## Speaker deck:
+ To be added


## Book recommendations & links from Maya:

+ The best C++ book Maya's come across to learn from is Andrew Koenig's ["Accelerated C++"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerated-Practical-Programming-Example-Series/dp/020170353X) 
+ All the Pointer Code was much more pure C and to learn that the source is still Kernighan and Ritchie's ["The C Programming language"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_1)
+ Maya used openFrameworks to demo the video tricks. You can download it here: http://openframeworks.cc/download/
  + For Linux and Windows she's had more luck with [code::blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)
