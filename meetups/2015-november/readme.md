### Part 1: Coding for the unhappy paths - presented by [_Lindsey Dew_](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lindsey-dew)

Often when we write code we focus on what happens when everything works as expected, but what happens when things fail? In Scala we can make use of the type system to develop code which behaves in an expected way even if the services it depends on fail.

_Lindsey is a software developer at The Guardian and writes code in Scala on a daily basis._

### Part 2: Introduction to functional programming - presented by [_Endre Galaczi_](https://twitter.com/galacziendre)

Endre gave us an introduction to functional programming and made it more accessible by comparing it to JavaScript.

_Endre is an aspiring software craftsman and python developer at MADE.COM who would love to get the opportunity to use functional programming languages more often._
