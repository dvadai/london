# Ladies of Code LDN | [April 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/236922126/)

Two ladies from 8th Light kindly introduced us to Elixir and its powers.

### An introduction to Elixir - presented by [_Daisy MÃ¸lving_](https://twitter.com/DaisyMolving)

This talk introduced basic examples and live code demos of some of the great features of Elixir.
We learnt how they can be used to make our code clean and concise.
And we finally understood what pattern matching is.

Georgina's talk introduced Elixir Umbrella projects which allow your overall application to be modelled as a collection of independent services; all under one repository.
Microservices are so yesterday. Umbrella projects is where it's at!
