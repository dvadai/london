#Ladies of Code LDN | Get together and build things

We run this meetup once in a while because it's a great opportunity to take some time out of our diary and finally focus on that side project we've always wanted to get done, learn that new language that we've been reading about or contribute to open source. Or maybe get help with a problem that we've been stuck on for a while.

Participants just need to bring their brilliant selves, their laptops, their ideas (or just their enthusiasm) for a night of coding, chatting and refreshments.

Beginners are welcome, too. We can help and dig up some resources to get you started.
