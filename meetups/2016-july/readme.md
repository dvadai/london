# Ladies of Code LDN | [July 2016](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/232609419/)

We love TDD, so we decided to spend an evening talking about it. We had an awesome talk, a demo and a workshop!


### Part 1: Inside out vs outside in TDD by [_Georgina McFadyen_](https://twitter.com/gemcfadyen)

Georgina presented her thoughts on inside out vs outside in TDD and explaining the differences with code examples. She also explained when she would use one practise over the other.

_Georgina is a software crafter at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/locations/london/)._

### Part 2: Live coding demo of the Roman Numerals kata - coded by [_Ina Tsetsova_](https://twitter.com/InaTsetsova)

Ina first test drove the Roman Numerals algorithm with unit tests. If you're not familiar with the kata, [find out more here](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RomanNumerals-Kata). Then she explained the concept of property based testing and wrote a few test examples for the roman numerals generator.

_Ina is a Maker's Academy graduate and future ThoughtWorker._

##### Read [Ina's blog post](http://tsetsova.github.io/events/2016/08/01/tdd-at-ladies-of-code.html) about the Roman Numerals kata and property based testing.

##### Ina also uploaded [her code to Github](https://github.com/tsetsova/roman_numerals).
