# Ladies of Code LDN | [November 2016](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/235075701)

This meetup was all about continuous integration and delivery. Our speaker was [Claudia Nobrega](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl%C3%A1udia-n%C3%B3brega-7a90a383), Deployment Lead at Ve Interactive.

She spoke about the process the company took from moving away from manual deployments to continuous delivery. She shared her personal point of view on how the process went and how that made her grow as a professional.

This meetup was a great opportunity to finally ask all the questions we had about CI and really understand the ins and outs of it. Claudia kindly took loads of time to answer all our questions!
