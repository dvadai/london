### Workshop: Find your inner tech talk - presented by [_Vedika Dalmia_](https://twitter.com/vedikad) and [_Katerina Domenikou_](https://twitter.com/kat_in_gloves)

Workshop description:

"Increase your visibility in a tech community by giving a tech talk! You might want to educate, attract talent to your organisation, or give back to the tech community. Join us in this exploratory workshop and discover what could make a great tech talk for you. Leave the room with a title for your tech talk, an abstract and bags of inspiration! 

We have a series of hands on exercises that attendees will work through to discover areas of expertise and then we help them narrow down to pick one topic for their next tech talk, and write an abstract for it."

Vedika and Katerina gave this presentation at both [Grace Hopper India](https://ghcischedule.anitab.org/blog/session/find-your-inner-tech-talk-topic-in-60-minutes/) and London conferences!
