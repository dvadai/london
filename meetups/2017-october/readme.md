# Ladies of Code LDN | [October 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/243272291/)

In October we had two talks related to front end and design.

### Help I'm not a designer! - presented by [_Shaz Jubeen_](https://twitter.com/ShazDaBaz) 

Shaz's talk was about setting up developers with best practises when it comes to designing products when they don't have access to a designer. She also talked about how to ensure accessibility is met and how to create a product that looks great.

_Shaz is a UI Designer at Tesco. She has worked with a range of companies from startups to large enterprises. Each have their own challenges and finding the best way to integrate and deliver usable products._


### Styled components - what are the and why use them? - presented by [_Jo Franchetti_](https://twitter.com/ThisIsJoFrank) 

Jo gave us an introduction to styled components and told us why her team has moved to writing their CSS in JavaScript. She also gave us a live code demo of swapping styles from your traditional stylesheet over into styled components.

_Jo is a front end developer with 6 years experience working in various parts of the tech industry from startups, agencies, charities to large organisations like Ticketmaster/Live Nation. She is a coach and organiser of Codebar and a coach at Code Your Future. She also runs a monthly event called Achieving Diversity in the Technology Industry._
